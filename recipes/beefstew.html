        <h3>Beef Stew</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>BEHOLD!</strong> If you've ever been to a really good Mexican hole-in-the-wall
            it's likely that you've encountered the colorful bowl of hot Caldo de Res. This traditional Mexican Beef stew
            is my personal favorite. 
        </p>
        <p>Every family has their own way of making it. Perfect with tortillas and some fresh squeezed lime, this stew is sure to bring a healthy warmth into your life.</p>
